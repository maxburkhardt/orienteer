# Orienteer

Orienteer is a navigation app that encourages exploration and discovery. It
will provide directions to a destination in the form of a bearing and distance,
and leaves it to you to find the most interesting or effective path.

Key features of Orienteer include:

- Destination autocomplete via the Google Places API
- Support for manually entered coordinate pairs
- Full offline functionality for navigation to any place stored in History, or
  a manually entered location
- An Apple Watch app, so you can easily navigate while walking or cycling
  without pulling out your phone
- Privacy-preserving options, including the ability to disable History or the
  use of your location in search queries
- Landscape and portrait orientation support
